Inserting 20M items still takes around 140 seconds, that can be improved I guess

Various things could be faster, need to profile

Adding a top level index with number_of_bits_set_in_key would improve searching I think

Adding arbitrary metadata would be nice (now it's just ints)

Persistent store/load would be nice for Real World(tm) application
	- having an export/import for a simstore would be better, then we don't have to care about how to persist here

FindClosest might be useless atm if that key has been added already (ie, it would just return "yes, I'm the closest to myself")

Lots of recursive stuff might benefit from goroutines

The bit_length "constant" defines a bunch of things but setting it to not-multiples-of-8 and/or not 8 will break many other things that depend on it being 8. It should be considered more of a "readability constant" I guess

When creating a new SimStore I think you should be able to specify what kind of hashing function to use somehow
