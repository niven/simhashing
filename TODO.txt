Inserting 20M items still takes around 140 seconds, that can be improved I guess

Various things could be faster, need to profile

Adding a top level index with number_of_bits_set_in_key would improve searching I think

Adding arbitrary metadata would be nice (now it's just ints)

Persistent store/load would be nice for Real World(tm) application
